- Tailwind CSS support
- Git integration tools
- Testing utilities

### `tasks.json`
Predefined tasks for:
- Development server (`dev`)

## How This Helps Copilot

1. **Context Awareness**: Copilot understands the project structure, patterns, and conventions
2. **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript definitions help with accurate suggestions
3. **Component Patterns**: Consistent component patterns lead to better code generation
4. **Architectural Guidelines**: Clear architectural decisions help maintain consistency
5. **Best Practices**: Documented patterns prevent common mistakes
6. **Testing Strategies**: Defined testing patterns improve test generation

## Usage Tips

1. **Reference Files**: When working on similar components, reference existing patterns in comments
2. **Type Definitions**: Use specific types from `types.md` in your prompts to Copilot
3. **Component Structure**: Follow the established component patterns for consistent results
4. **Naming Conventions**: Use the documented naming conventions for better suggestions

## Example Prompts

When working with Copilot Chat, you can reference these patterns:

```
"Create a new tool component following the ToolPageProps pattern with proper error handling and loading states"

"Generate a form component using the FormField pattern with validation"

"Create a modal component following the Modal pattern with keyboard navigation"

"Add proper TypeScript types following the project's type patterns"
```

## Maintenance

Keep these files updated as the project evolves:
- Add new patterns when introducing architectural changes
- Update type definitions when interfaces change
- Document new conventions as they're established
- Keep examples current with the latest code

This configuration ensures GitHub Copilot provides contextually appropriate, type-safe, and architecturally consistent code suggestions for the Dev Tool Kit project.
